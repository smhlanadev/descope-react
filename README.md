# Add Magic Link Authentication & RBAC to Your React App
Explore the Magic Link and RBAC features of Descope for a React application. Create roles, manage access and enhance the user experience by avoiding password-related issues, while simplifying the authentication process for developers by reducing the complexity of implementing authentication.

This project is created using React and integrates with the Descope API to create a seamless authentication and authorization flow.
## Getting Started
Here are the things you will need to get this project running:
### Prerequisites
- [Node v20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [A Descope Free Forever Account](https://www.descope.com/sign-up)
- An email account. [You can use a free temporary email service](https://temp-mail.org/en/)

Use a command line interface (cmd, PowerShell etc.), follow the steps below:
### Step 1. Clone or download this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/smhlanadev/descope-react.git

Enter the email address you want to authenticate with and click on **Continue**. You will receive an email with the link. Click on the link, and you will be authenticated and redirected to the application.
